  - [Advanced project](generators/advanced-base/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:advanced-base`
  - [Jest](generators/jest/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:jest`
  - [Fastlane setup for multiple environments](generators/fastlane-setup/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-setup`
  - [Fastlane environment instantiation](generators/fastlane-env/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-env`
  - [Icons and Splashscreen generation](generators/assets/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:assets [--icon | --splash] <path>`
- Environment
  - [Visual Studio Code](generators/vscode/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:vscode`
- Continuous integration / deployment
  - [TravisCI](generators/travisci/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:travisci`
  - [Bitrise for continuous deployment](generators/bitrise/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:bitrise`
  - [CircleCI for continuous deployment](generators/circleci/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:circleci`

## Requirements

- [ ] You need `node > 6` installed
- [ ] Ruby > `2.2.3`
- [ ] Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`)
- [ ] Yeoman installed (`npm i -g yo`)
- [ ] Yarn installed (`brew install yarn`)

## Usage

Install the main `yeoman` generator:

```
npm install -g yo generator-rn-toolbox
```

Then follow the docs for any sub-generator listed above in the [features](https://github.com/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox#features).

If starting from scratch, use the `react-native init <ProjectName> && cd <ProjectName>` command to instantiate your React Native Project (for more [go see the official React Native getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)).

It is recommended to initiate the git repository right after instantiating the app and to do you first commit.

It is also recommended to do a separate commit after running each of these steps.

## Contributing
