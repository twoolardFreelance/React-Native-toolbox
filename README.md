# React Native Toolbox [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/generator-rn-toolbox.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-rn-toolbox) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

Yeoman generators to kickstart your react-native v0.38+ projects.

*As of now, the way those generators are configured is heavily opinionated and based on our own company needs.*

## Features

In an existing React Native project, our generator contains sub-generators that will help you with:

- Setup
  - [Linting](generators/lint/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:lint`
  - [Base project](generators/base/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:base`
  - [Jest](generators/jest/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:jest`
  - [Fastlane setup for multiple environments](generators/fastlane-setup/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-setup`
  - [Fastlane environment instantiation](generators/fastlane-env/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:fastlane-env`
  - [Icons and Splashscreen generation](generators/assets/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:assets [--icon |Â --splash] <path>`
- Environment
  - [Visual Studio Code](generators/vscode/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:vscode`
  - [Wallaby.js](generators/wallaby/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:wallaby`
- Continuous integration / deployment
  - [TravisCI](generators/travisci/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:travisci`
  - [CircleCI](generators/circleci/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:circleci`
  - [Bitrise for continuous deployment](generators/bitrise/README.md) -- `yo rn-toolbox:bitrise`

## Requirements

- [ ] You need `node > 6` installed
- [ ] Ruby > `2.2.3` (and < `2.4`*)
- [ ] Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`)
- [ ] Yeoman installed (`npm i -g yo`)
- [ ] Yarn installed (`npm i -g yarn`)

\* Some gem dependencies (see issue [#51](https://github.com/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox/pull/51)) are not compatible with Ruby >= `2.4` (as of 2017-01-11).

## Usage

Install the main `yeoman` generator:
```
npm install -g yo generator-rn-toolbox
```

Then follow the docs for any sub-generator listed above in the [features](https://github.com/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox#features).

If starting from scratch, use the `react-native init <ProjectName> && cd <ProjectName>` command to instantiate your React Native Project (for more [go see the official React Native getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)).

It is recommended to initiate the git repository right after instantiating the app and to do you first commit.

It is also recommended to do a separate commit after running each of these steps.
