Hi, thanks for submitting a Pull Request! :balloon:

Before submitting, please be sure to check a few things:

## Commit names formatting

This repository is automatically published to npm with
[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

In order to manage that, your commit should follow the AngularJS commit
conventions
[as explained here](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#default-commit-message-format)

You can use `yarn commit` to write a commit respecting this convention.
