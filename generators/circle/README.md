# Circle setup

*CircleCI is a continuous integration solution allowing you to run your test each time you do a pull request*

In order to make circleCI working on your app, you need to create a circle.yml file by running

`yo rn-toolbox:circle`

Then you have to configure the branch on which you want to trigger circleCI webhook directly on GitHub :)
